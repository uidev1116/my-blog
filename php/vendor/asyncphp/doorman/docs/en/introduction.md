# Introduction

This library aims to provide a simple interface for creating and managing child processes. This is useful for parallel processing of expensive and non-critical tasks.

There are many great libraries that do something similar to this. They usually require PHP `5.4` or additional extensions. Here are two you should also check out:

- [React](https://github.com/reactphp/child-process)
- [Icicle](https://github.com/icicleio/concurrent)
